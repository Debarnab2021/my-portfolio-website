      Cricket has been around for more than 100 years. It has become famous all over the globe. If you're looking for the outdoor sport which you can pursue as a hobby, cricket is one of the best options for you.
<br>
Moreover, its popularity ensures that you can take it up as a professional sport as well. This would help you in building an entire career in cricket.
<br>
Moreover, the sport is a proper physical exercise which ensures that you are able to remain fit as well.

      <br>
      Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.
<br>
My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.
    At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.

Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat & bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was identified as the best bowler of the St Lawrence School (my school) at the age of 10 which was a great achievement for me and my parents in the year 2019.</b></p>
